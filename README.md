# Dissertation_Project
This repository contains code, data, and documentation for my Master's dissertation: "Comparing Similarity Between Two Territory Partitions in Districting Problem Using Weighted Pair Counting Similarity Indices." Includes algorithms, datasets, and results for comparing territorial partitions in districting problems.

# Project Structure
* root directory
    * project/: Contains all source code, headers, and build fiiles.
    * include/: Header files.
    * src/: Source files.
    * Makefile: Script for building the project.

# Compilation Instructions
To compile the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the 'project/' directory:

2. Execute the 'make' command to build the project:

3. The compiled binary will be created as a file named 'Project' in the 'project/' directory.

# Running the Project
To run the compiled project, execute the 'Project' binary from the 'project/' directory, passing an integer as an argument. This integer specifies the number of iterations for perturbation.

Replace '<number_of_iterations>' with the desired number of iterations.
